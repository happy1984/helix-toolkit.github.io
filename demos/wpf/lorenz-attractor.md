title: Lorenz Attractor demo (WPF)
---

- Open the "ExampleBrowser" application to run this example.
- The source code can be found in `Source\Examples\ExampleBrowser\Examples\LorenzAttractor`

This demo plots the trajectory of Lorenz's equations, rendered as a tube with arrows to show direction and 3D structure.
See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor) for more informations on the Lorenz attractor.

The demo is using the MeshBuilder to create the tube and arrows and the HelixViewport3D control to manipulate the camera.
