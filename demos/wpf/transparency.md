- Open the "ExampleBrowser" application to run this example.
- The source code can be found in `Source\Examples\ExampleBrowser\Examples\Transparency`

This application demonstrates how to use the `SortingVisual3D` to sort child objects with distance to camera.
For simple scenes without overlapping objects this will help to make transparency look right.
