## [2.2.0] - 2018-6-17
### Added
1. Add per-frame draw call in RenderDetail.
2. Add pingpong buffer for post effects. Add depth stencil buffer pooling
3. Add RenderTechnique serialization/deserialization.
4. Add BlendFactor/SampleMask/StencilRef in ShaderPassDescription.
5. Port DynamicCodeSurface3D to SharpDX version.

### Improvement and Changes
1. Move FXAA before post effect.
 ##### Pre(such as shadow map)->Opaque->Particle->Transparent->FXAA->Post(post effects)->ScreenSpaced(ViewBox/CoordinateSystem).
2. Change to use specific material for mesh shading technique change. Added DiffuseMaterial(Render DiffuseColor/DiffuseMap only), NormalMaterial(Render Normals as Color), PositionColorMaterial(Render Vertex Position as Color), VertColorMaterial(Render Per Vertex Color). Remove separated techniques for normal/position/color rendering. Merge these passes into default BlinnPhong techniques.
3. Encapsulate D3D11.DeviceContext functions into DeviceContextProxy. Skip redundant state bindings/shaderpass bindings.
4. Re-implement shader class.
